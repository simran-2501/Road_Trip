							<p>Questions formed.in my head
Where should i go?
What should I do?
Be a Doctor they tell me 
No, be an engineer.

They talk and talk 
But they don't listen
All their words i block them

Shut up!! I yell
I don't want to be you, or mom or dad
I don't want to be great 
Or have my name in lights
I just want to be me 
Nobody else
Stop talking and listen 

Just let me be me..</p>

							<h2>The girl in the garbaje bag</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>They don't understand her 
They don't hear her 
She has no saying in this

They scream at her 
calling her foul names
if they just listen 

They grab her
she tries to escape
She cries
Looking in to that man's eyes
She begs forgiveness

Why are you doing?
horror in her eyes
Please just let me explain
NO! not there 

Inside its dark
Not enough air to breath
HELP!! She cries please help me

Her tiny fingers try to break it 
Its to strong for her
she cries one more time 
hoping someone will hear
Silence...

She finally gives up 
curls in to a ball
and waits for her death
in that dark and scary place
the girl fell asleep
all of this is true..</p>

							<p>He came broke her heart and left
And just like that it ended
He left her alone in that 
Park beach, with tear on her eyes
She cries herself to sleep
While he is having fun
She misses him
He doesn't care
But one day will come 
When he will finally realize
That she was the one 
But she will have moved on
Now he will cry
And he will miss her
And she will not care.</p>

							<h2>EVERYTHING AND NOTHING</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>I have it all
Cellphones, cars
Houses, diamonds, 
Gold, airplanes and jets
I own a star, i have lands, 
lets not forget a house by the lake

Yes indeed, i have it all
Yet I have nothing
No love, no real friends
No family family to go to
The house by the lake

This question keeps 
Turning around my head
How can I have everything, 
And yet have nothing as well?I have it all
Cellphones, cars
Houses, diamonds, 
Gold, airplanes and jets
I own a star, i have lands, 
lets not forget a house by the lake
