							<p> As a normal person, i'm also have my own ambition. My ambition is to become an engineer. It is not just an ambition but i want it to become a reality to my life. It is true that years of hard work are required to become an engineer, but after of three years of college studying engineering, you can make good money. In fact, engineering is one of the few fields that let you earn good pay after only three years. Right now, three years might sound like a long time, but it's worth it. Consider it one of the best investment you can make. Besides, it's not all about the money. It is also an interesting work.</p>

							<p> Engineering is a very broad field. There are so many types of engineering, that there is bound to be one you find interest in. Since science and technology are constantly expanding, there will always be new problems to solve-you'll rarely be bored. Unlike other jobs that require you to do the same thing over and over, the work of engineers greatly varies.</p>

							<p> In engineering, you will find yourself constantly finding new ways to solve problems. If you truly want to be an engineer, the challenges you will face will just make things more interesting. Overcoming obstacles will help sharpen your mind, helping you deal with problems not only in engineering but in life as well.</p>

							<p>  In facing challenges, you will be encouraged to "think outside of the box" and explore new possibilities. This need to creativity makes engineering even more exciting. There's no better feeling than the feeling that you accomplished something great. In engineering, you're doing just that. Imagine looking at a bridge that you helped design or picking up a new invention that you created.</p>

							<p> Engineering is all about making things people can use and making life better for everybody. As an engineer, you will be able to see that you're actually making a difference in the world. There is indeed great strength in diversity. Engineering requires many different perspectives to find a single workable solution. You have the power to show the world what you can do. Don't always follow the crowd-show people that you are unique but just as capable as anyone else.</p>
